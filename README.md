## üìö Past Projects
**Drug Review Sentiment Analysis**  
The focus of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on patient reviews for various drugs. The goal is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of reviews based on textual data and related features such as drug name, condition treated, and patient ratings. The sentiment prediction will help pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals gain insights into patient satisfaction, identify potential issues with drugs, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

- **Objective**: Enhance healthcare decision-making by analyzing drug reviews.
- **Method**: NLP and machine learning techniques to process and classify sentiment.
